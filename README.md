## But what are planets and what is the solar system?

Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit a star, and in our case, they revolve around the Sun. They must be massive enough for gravity to shape them into a sphere and must clear their orbital path of other debris. Our solar system contains eight such planets—ranging from rocky worlds like Earth and Mars to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn—along with dwarf planets such as Pluto. The solar system itself is the collection of everything bound to the Sun by gravity. This includes the eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and countless smaller objects. It sits in a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and represents just one of many planetary systems in the universe.
